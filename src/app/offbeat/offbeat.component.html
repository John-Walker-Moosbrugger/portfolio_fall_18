      <p class="float__text text__regular">Off-Beat was the culmination of a semester long Service Design project. Service design is a framework of design thinking which is unique in that it considers all parts of an organization as part of the design. For example, a service designer working for a restaurant chain would consider far more than normal customer experiences and touchpoints (waitstaff, menuâ€™s, ect.). Their design would include the backstage processes, from how food is delivered to how the kitchen staff receives the orders in order to provide the best experience to all stakeholders.</p>

      <p class="float__text text__regular">For this project we were tasked with designing a music related service that targeted an audience other than the mass market.</p>
